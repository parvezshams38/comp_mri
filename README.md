# comp_mri
This repository includes different algorithms used in MRI. It has implementaion of Margosian, POCS (Week 3), SENSE (week 5)  and GRAPPA (week 6) from scratch using basic functions from numpy. It also has implementaion of some non-cartesian reconstruction, CS (compressed sensing) and VarNet. 

All of these were done as part of the course computaional MRI taught by Professor Florian Knoll at FAU Erlangen.
